# **AI-Powered Complaint Resolution System for Indian Railways – Rail Madad Enhancement**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to enhance the **Rail Madad platform** for Indian Railways by leveraging **artificial intelligence (AI)** to automate the complaint management process. The platform is designed to streamline complaint categorization, prioritization, and routing, ensuring faster and more accurate resolution, especially for multimedia submissions (photos, videos, etc.).

By utilizing **AI-driven technologies**, this project seeks to reduce manual intervention, improve operational efficiency, and ultimately elevate the overall passenger experience.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Multilingual Text and Speech Processing**
   - Utilizes **MuRIL** for multilingual text understanding, and **Whisper by OpenAI** for speech recognition.
   - Ensures that the system supports multiple Indian languages, making it accessible to a diverse range of users.

### 2. **Visual Input Processing**
   - Incorporates **MobileNetV3** and **Tesseract OCR** for analyzing multimedia inputs like photos and videos.
   - Automatically categorizes complaints based on visual content (e.g., cleanliness, damage).

### 3. **Edge Computation and On-Device Processing**
   - Powered by **TensorFlow Lite** and **ONNX Runtime**, the system is optimized for mobile and low-power devices.
   - Ensures efficient processing of data at the edge, enabling fast response times without relying entirely on cloud services.

### 4. **AI Chatbot Integration**
   - Chatbots powered by **ParlAI / RASA** and **PyTorch** handle initial user interaction and gather additional details from passengers.
   - Provides immediate acknowledgment and helps users with complaint registration, reducing wait times.

### 5. **Proactive Maintenance**
   - Predictive models identify recurring issues, enabling proactive maintenance before major disruptions occur.
   - Enhances train reliability and reduces service interruptions.

### 6. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
   - AI-powered algorithms prioritize high-urgency complaints and allocate resources accordingly.
   - Ensures critical issues are resolved promptly, improving overall passenger satisfaction.

### 7. **Data-Driven Insights**
   - AI analytics provide real-time insights into operational efficiency and complaint trends.
   - Enables continuous improvement of services based on data-driven decisions.

### 8. **Cost-Effective and Scalable**
   - The platform is built using **lightweight AI models** (e.g., MobileNetV3 for image processing, MuRIL for NLP) and **cloud infrastructure** (e.g., AWS), reducing operational costs.
   - Scalable to handle increasing volumes of complaints as the Rail Madad platform expands.
